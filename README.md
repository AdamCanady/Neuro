Synecdoche
Neurological exam/ assessment using an XBOX Kinect and Leap

Introduction:

The goal of this project is to attempt to replicate the neurological assessments and tests done in office by neurologists. We are attempting to use an xbox kinect and a leap to measure the ability of the patient to complete each test. Comprehensive Neurological tests include sensory parts where the practitioner must touch the patients, these tests would not be able to be conducted. We believe however that using a kinect would allow for more precise measurements on other tests and allow the patient to not only perform these tests from the comfort of their own home but also to track their progress or look for signs of developing conditions.

This group will meet weekly during Spring term. (A doodle will be sent out in early spring to determine availability). The goal is to implement a comprehensive neurological assessment and write a paper detailing our process and methods.



Schedule / Timeline / To Do list:
Contact neurologists
Understand basic tests and what patient must physically do for each
Understand what is being measured for each test, how measurements are taken, and the limits of current measurements
Hack on XBOX Kinect (some of the team will start doing this at the beginning)
User trials/ testing
Iterate

Ideas for tests:
bounded boxes where the patient must keep their extremities while they move around (range of motion test)
boxes move in defined ROM but with varying speeds (reaction and speed)
patient must repeat a learned motion
endurance (hold arm up for a long time)
cross body test (another range of motion)
